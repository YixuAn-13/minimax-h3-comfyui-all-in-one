# ComfyUI Minimax H3 Latent Upscaler

**Neural Latent Upscaler for Minimax H3 Video Generation**
Learned · High-fidelity · 2D & 3D Variants

</div>

## 📰 News

- [2026-08-21] 🚀 **3D node optimization**: The model is automatically offloaded to CPU after execution to free VRAM for subsequent second-pass sampling; width and height are independently aligned to the align grid (default 32), fixing the bottom light band issue; normalization/denormalization is changed from in-place operations to standard operations; temporal chunking is retained to support long videos.
- [2026-08-19] 🚀 **3D node overhaul**: all three resize modes (`scale by multiplier`, `target dimensions`, `megapixels`) merged into a single node; fixed aspect-ratio mismatch in certain modes and edge artifacts at specific sizes; added a new example workflow and expanded the usage notes.
- [2026-08-18] 🔥 **Precision selector**: both 2D and 3D nodes now support `fp32` / `fp16` / `bf16` inference.
- [2026-08-17] 🎉 **Initial release**: Minimax H3 Latent Upscaler 2D + 3D nodes with bilingual README and inline examples.

A custom ComfyUI node that upscales **Minimax H3** VAE latents (24 channels) with a trained
neural network instead of naive interpolation. Its main purpose is to **accelerate
high-resolution video generation** and improve quality:

- **Skip the slow decode → pixel-upscale → encode round-trip.** Minimax H3 ships a heavy
  ~5B-parameter VAE, so decoding and re-encoding latents is expensive. Upscaling directly in
  latent space avoids that costly round-trip entirely.
- **Enable a faster generation pipeline:** generate at low resolution (far fewer latent tokens),
  upscale the latent with this node, then refine at the target resolution.

It also **avoids the ghosting / double-image artifacts** that naive latent interpolation
(bilinear/bicubic) introduces, and plays a role similar to the latent upscaler in **LTX2.3**.

⚠️ This saves **time, not VRAM** — the refinement pass still runs at the target resolution, so
peak memory is comparable to generating high-res directly. The win is purely speed.

Two node variants are provided, both registered under the `video/MinimaxH3` category:

- **Minimax H3 Latent Upscaler (2D)** — a 2D ResBlock backbone with Temporal 3D-Conv layers
  inserted for temporal consistency. Spatial (H×W) upscaling; the time dimension is preserved.
  Lightweight and fast. Uses a simple `scale` factor (1.0×–4.0×).
- **Minimax H3 Latent Upscaler (3D)** — a fully 3D-convolution backbone (3D ResBlocks +
  TemporalConv + trilinear interpolation). Processes the spatiotemporal volume jointly for
  stronger temporal coherence; heavier on compute/memory. Supports **three resize modes** in one
  node:
  - `scale by multiplier` — classic `scale` factor (1.0×–4.0×).
  - `target dimensions` — directly set target pixel `width`/`height`.
  - `megapixels` — set a target total pixel count in megapixels (e.g. `1.2`); keeps aspect ratio.
  Both `target dimensions` and `megapixels` modes align the output to a configurable pixel grid and
  derive the effective scale automatically.

> The 3D node computes the equivalent `scale` internally for the size-based modes and feeds it to
> the same trained model, so any target between 1.0×–4.0× works.

> Both nodes support **upscaling only** (`effective scale >= 1.0`). `scale = 1.0` returns the input
> unchanged; an effective scale below `1.0` raises an error.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Learned latent upscaling** — neural network trained for Minimax H3 latents, far sharper
  than bilinear/bicubic interpolation.
- ✅ **Two backbones** — pick the fast **2D** variant or the temporally-coherent **3D** variant.
- ✅ **Three ways to set output size on the 3D node** — `scale by multiplier`, `target dimensions`,
  or `megapixels`, all with pixel-grid alignment and aspect-ratio lock.
- ✅ **24-channel Minimax H3 latent** — uses the exact per-channel mean/std normalization from
  training.
- ✅ **Auto architecture detection** — reads `in_channels`, block counts, temporal config and
  kernel size straight from the checkpoint; no manual config needed.
- ✅ **Robust weight loader** — supports `.safetensors` and `.pth`; auto-converts FP8→FP16;
  tolerates the `upscaler.` prefix in merged checkpoints.
- ✅ **Flexible precision/device** — `cuda`/`cpu` and fp32/fp16/bf16 options.
- ✅ **Plug-and-play** — standard ComfyUI node, no changes to your existing workflow.

Inference forces attention **off** (`attn=False`) for speed and stability. Loaded models are
cached by `(name, device, precision)` so repeated runs stay cheap.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository into ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/LBH-123-AI/Comfyui_Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler.git
   ```

2. Required dependencies (`torch`, `einops`, `safetensors`) are already present in a standard
   ComfyUI environment — no extra install needed.

3. Restart ComfyUI.

## 🤖 Model Placement

The nodes scan and load weights from:

```text
ComfyUI/models/latent_upscale_models/
```

Put your Minimax H3 latent upscaler checkpoint (`.safetensors` or `.pth`) there. It will appear
automatically in the node's `model_name` dropdown.

Pre-trained checkpoints are available at:
[huggingface.co/LBH-123-AI/Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler](https://huggingface.co/LBH-123-AI/Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler)

The loader auto-detects the architecture, so a single checkpoint works for both the 2D and 3D
nodes as long as the stored structure matches.

## 🧩 Usage

Add the node you need from the `video/MinimaxH3` menu, connect a `LATENT`, pick the model, set the
resize mode / scale, and decode.

**Typical workflow:**
- **Quick preview:** `[Minimax H3 Latent] → [H3 Latent Upscaler] → [VAE Decode]`
- **High quality / time-saving (recommended):** `[Low-res Latent] → [H3 Latent Upscaler] → [Refine / Re-sample] → [VAE Decode]`

Compared to the naive approach `[Latent] → [VAE Decode] → [Pixel Upscaler] → [VAE Encode] → …`,
upscaling directly in latent space skips the expensive VAE decode/encode round-trip. Minimax H3's
~5B-parameter VAE makes decode and re-encode notably slow, so this is where most of the time is
saved. It also avoids the **ghosting / double-image artifacts** that direct latent interpolation
(bilinear/bicubic) causes.

⚠️ **Saves time, not VRAM:** the refinement still runs at the target resolution, so peak memory is
roughly the same as generating high-res directly. The benefit is purely faster turnaround.

> `target dimensions` / `megapixels`.

## 🧪 Model / Architecture

- **Latent format:** 24-channel Minimax H3 VAE latent, normalized per-channel with the training
  mean/std before inference and de-normalized after.
- **Default detected architecture** (overridden automatically if the checkpoint differs):
  `in_channels=24`, `in_blocks=12`, `out_blocks=12`, `base_channels=512`, `dropout=0.1`,
  `temporal_every=2`, `temporal_kernel=5`, `attn=False`.
- **Interpolation:** the 2D node uses bilinear feature interpolation; the 3D node uses trilinear.
- **Temporal handling:** both variants preserve the time dimension (only H×W are scaled).

## 📊 Training Data

The upscaler was trained on **~80,000 paired samples** (a low-resolution latent paired with its
high-resolution target), balanced across modalities and scale factors to maximize generalization.

**By data modality:**

| Modality | Pairs | Share |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Video clips | ~70,000 | ~87.5% |
| 2K images | ~8,000 | ~10% |

**By upscale factor (scale distribution, approximate):**

| Scale | Share | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2× | 40% | Dominant factor — the most common real-world case |
| 1.5× | 10% | — |
| 2.5× | 10% | — |
| 3× | 10% | — |
| 4× | 10% | — |
| 1.0×–4.0× (arbitrary decimals) | 10% | Improves generalization to in-between / non-fixed scales |

The heavy emphasis on **2× (40%)** matches the most common practical use case, while the **10% spread
of arbitrary decimal scales between 1 and 4** prevents overfitting to the fixed 1.5×/2×/2.5×/3×/4×
buckets — letting the model handle any continuous `scale` in the 1.0×–4.0× range at inference time.
